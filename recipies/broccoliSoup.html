    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>8 cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
        <li><h4>Step</h4>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li><h4>Step</h4>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. 
            <br>Saute onion and celery until tender.  </li>
        <li><h4>Step</h4> Add broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><h4>Step</h4>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full.
            <br> Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, 
            <br>and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree.
            <br> Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot.
            <br> Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. </li>
        <li><h4>Step</h4>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to medium-low heat; 
            <br>stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and add to soup.
            <br> Season with pepper and serve. </li>
        <li><h4>Step</h4>Serve hot and enjoy, you filthy animal.</li>
    </ol>
